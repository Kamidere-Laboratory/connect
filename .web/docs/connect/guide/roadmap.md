# Connect Development

_This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as Connect progresses._

## Project Roadmap

We are just getting started with the open Connect platform, and we are excited to see what the future holds.
There are a lot of ideas being worked on hard to extend Connect and make it even more useful for creators and players.


Our major goal is to keep Connect a stable and reliable service that is
always on, always developing and the core features free to use for everyone.

## Core of Connect Platform

### Connect Plugin

Multi-platform supporting Minecraft Java plugins for
SpigotMC/PaperMC, Gate, BungeeCord, Velocity, Sponge, and more.

### Connect Network

- Connect Edge Proxies
- Connect APIs

### Connect Hub

In-Game Server Browser Hub 

## Additional Features

### Search

- Find the top-rated game servers and quickly join them
- See the history of servers you were connected on to join back later
- Search for any game server registered with Connect Network and filter by category, tags, and more

### Maps

**As a player:**
You walk through the world and explore previews of every game server.
You like what you see? Jump into its portal, and you get connected to the server in a blink of an eye!

**As a server creator:**
You design the gate of your game server to make it appealing to players walking by.
Only limited to the Minecraft blocks available and your imagination you have an area
where you can transfer the spirit of your games to advertise your server to new players.

# The step-by-step plan to increase adoption

We plan to grow the `Connect community` in phases and increase adoption of Connect
step-by-step starting with targeting the most important features and audiences.

The goal is to grow the following counting factors:
- Connect Plugin **installations**
- Servers **linked** to Connect Network
- Users playing on servers **through** Connect Network

### Step #1 - Friends & Local Host Servers

Our first target audience are friends that want to play together on their local host servers.

### Step #2 - Grow creators & players pool

Our second target audiences are creators that want to grow their player base and players
that want to discover new servers.

Here we will focus on the Connect Browser to make it an interactive 
in-game server list where players can surf, join and review servers with their friends.

Gamification, Referral and Friends systems will be keys to success at this phase and beyond.

### Step #3 - Developers

Our third target audience are developers to allow them to extend the Connect Platform
and build their own plugins and services on top of it by using public Connect APIs.

Connect integrates a developer platform and marketplace for Minecraft plugins 
and services integrated with Connect.

# Use cases

### Use case: Make your local Minecraft server public

Yes! As soon as your server is connected to the Connect Network
players can join your Minecraft server even if it's running locally
on your PC without configuring any port forwarding.
You can read along [here](/guide/#public-localhost-servers).

### Use case: Interconnect your Minecraft servers easily

The Connect Network serves as a Proxy-as-a-Service and replaces
traditional Minecraft proxies like BungeeCord. You no longer need
to configure and maintain a secure proxy for your Minecraft servers.
The only thing you need is the [Connect Plugin](/guide/quick-start#downloading-the-connect-plugin)
installed on your servers.

### Use case: Advertise your server for more players

Connect is a public place to browse through all _Connected_ servers
from ingame. That means players either directly join your server by your domain
or discover your server in the Connect Browser Hub.

### Use case: Move players between your servers without managing an own proxy

No more need to deploy your own proxies since Connect Network already
works like a global shared proxy where servers and even other sub-proxies
can connect to.

As the server owner you can control all your connected servers and players.
There will be public APIs available for you to manage your connected endpoints (servers or proxies)
and players like sending players a message, moving them between your servers and so on.

## Reminders for the future

- Support [Skript](https://forums.skunity.com/resources/skript.323/) with an addon
to easily integrate Connect into your Skript scripts and manage your servers and players.
