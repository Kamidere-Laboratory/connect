# Server Domains

_What are server endpoint domains and how to use them?_

## What is a domain?

An Internet domain is a unique name that identifies a server or a website.
Connect provides a free public domain for every server that uses the Connect Plugin automatically
to allow players to join directly instead of first joining `minekube.net` and using the Browser Hub.

## Joining your Server

For more information on how to join your server see [Joining your Server](joining).

## Bringing your own domain

::: warning This feature is not yet available.
Feel free to request this feature on our [Discord](https://minekube.com/discord) to be added sooner.
:::

Sometimes you want to use your own domain for your server to let player join with.
This is great to build trust and a brand around your server and to make it easier for players to remember.

You are able to point your domain to your free public domain `<endpoint>.play.minekube.net` with a CNAME record
and adding the domain to your Connect config to trust your domain.
