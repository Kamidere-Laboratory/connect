# The step-by-step plan to increase adoption

We plan to grow the `Connect community` in phases and increase adoption of Connect
step-by-step starting with targeting the most important features and audiences.

The goal is to grow the following counting factors:
- Connect Plugin **installations**
- Servers **linked** to Connect Network
- Users playing on servers **through** Connect Network

## Step #1 - Friends & Local Host Servers

Our first target audience are friends that want to play together on their local host servers
and servers owners experimenting with Connect.

## Step #2 - Grow creators & players pool

Our second target audiences are creators that want to grow their player base and players
that want to discover new servers.

Here we will focus on the Connect Browser to make it an interactive 
in-game server list where players can surf, join and review servers with their friends.

Gamification, Referral and Friends systems will be keys to success at this phase and beyond.

## Step #3 - Developers

Our third target audience are developers to allow them to extend the Connect Platform
and build their own plugins and services on top of it by using public Connect APIs.

Connect integrates a developer platform and marketplace for Minecraft plugins 
and services integrated with Connect.
