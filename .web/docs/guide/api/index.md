# Connect API

<VPBadge>early stage</VPBadge>

_The Connect API is a powerful tool for developers
to integrate Connect into their projects and products.
Interact with players and [endpoints](/guide/#connect-endpoints) on the [Connect Network](/guide/#the-connect-network)
through the Connect API._

## Getting started

- [API Clients](/guide/api/clients) - Connect provides code generated API clients!
- [Code Examples](/guide/api/examples) - See the Connect API in action.

Connect APIs supports [multiple API protocols](https://connect.build/docs/multi-protocol):

- Buf's own protocol called [`Connect`](https://connect.build/docs/introduction)
  - _Not to be confused with the Connect API itself, the same name is coincidence._
- [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) as it's primary communication protocol.
  gRPC is a high performance, open source, well-known RPC framework developed by Google.
- gRPC-Web - A subset of gRPC that works in the browser.
