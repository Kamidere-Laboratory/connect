# Connect API
<VPBadge>early stage</VPBadge>

_The Connect API is a powerful tool for developers
to integrate Connect into their projects and products.
Interact with players and [endpoints](/guide/#connect-endpoints) on the [Connect Network](/guide/#the-connect-network)
through the Connect API._

## Getting started

You can quickly get started with [Buf Remote Packages](https://buf.build/minekube/connect/assets/main)
that provide client libraries for many programming languages for the Connect API.

Read further to learn how to use **Java or Kotlin**.

## Authentication

Using the Connect API requires authentication with a valid API token
so that Connect knows who is making requests and what permissions you have.

Go to the [Authentication guide](/guide/api/authentication).
