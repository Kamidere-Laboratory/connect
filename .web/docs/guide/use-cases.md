# Use cases

_This use-cases list is a living document and will be updated as Connect progresses._

## Make your local Minecraft server public

Yes! As soon as your server is connected to the Connect Network
players can join your Minecraft server even if it's running locally
on your PC without configuring any port forwarding.
You can read along [here](/guide/#public-localhost-servers).

## Interconnect your Minecraft servers easily

The Connect Network serves as a Proxy-as-a-Service and replaces
traditional Minecraft proxies like BungeeCord. You no longer need
to configure and maintain a secure proxy for your Minecraft servers.
The only thing you need is the [Connect Plugin](/guide/quick-start#downloading-the-connect-plugin)
installed on your servers.

## Advertise your server to more players

Connect is a public place to browse through all _Connected_ servers
from ingame. That means players either directly join your server by your domain
or discover your server in the Connect Browser Hub.

## Move players between your servers without managing an own proxy

No more need to deploy your own proxies since Connect Network already
works like a global shared proxy where servers and even other sub-proxies
can connect to.

As the server owner you can control all your connected servers and players.
There will be public APIs available for you to manage your connected endpoints (servers or proxies)
and players like sending players a message, moving them between your servers and so on.
