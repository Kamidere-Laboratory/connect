# Advertising Channels for Your Server

_Advertising your server is an important part of growing your community.
Connect provides a few ways to advertise your server to players._

## Browser Hub

The Browser Hub is the _in-game server list_ that allows
players to discover and join servers from in-game.

Players can join the Browser Hub on `minekube.net` or by running the `/browser` command
from any server they are playing on to jump back.
